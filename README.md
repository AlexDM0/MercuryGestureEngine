# Mercury Gesture Engine
C++ OpenCV application for realtime tracking of gestures.

This application assumes that there is one person in view. The person is roughly looking towards the camera and visible from hips to head. 

This is made to compile with Visual Studio 2015 (community edition) using v14.
